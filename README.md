# Resume-Selector
Resume Selector Using Naive Bayes Classifier


In this project, we will build a naive based model to predict whether given resume text is flagged or not. Simply put, if the resume is flagged, that means that the applicant is invited to interview.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Apply python libraries to import and visualize datasets
2.	Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
3.	Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
4.	Perform tokenization using count vectorizer
5.	Train Naïve Bayes classifier models using Scikit-Learn to perform classification
6.	Evaluate the performance of trained Naïve Bayes Classifier model using confusion matrices
